## Overview

Current healthcare management within educational institutes often lacks a unified system for securely maintaining and accessing student health records. Health-Track was built to address these challenges by offering:
- Secure storage of comprehensive health records (medical history, prescriptions, treatment records, etc.).
- Easy access for students to view past medical records and treatment history.
- Automated generation of documentation (e.g., medical certificates and leave permissions).
- A user-friendly, responsive interface optimized for both mobile and web.

## Key Features

- **Mobile and Web Compatibility:**  
  A responsive design that ensures a seamless experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Comprehensive Health Records Access:**  
  A personal dashboard that allows students to view their entire medical history, including consultation records, prescriptions, and diagnostic reports. Users can also download records as PDFs for offline use or sharing.

- **Automated Documentation Generation:**  
  Ability to request and generate official documents such as medical certificates or leave permissions by selecting specific time periods or health issues.

- **Appointment Booking and Management:**  
  Functionality to book appointments with healthcare providers, receive confirmations and reminders, and easily reschedule or cancel appointments.

- **Search and Filter Functionality:**  
  A robust search system to filter through medical records by keywords (e.g., doctor names, diagnosis, treatment dates) and various filters like date, treatment type, or severity.

- **Notifications and Reminders:**  
  Integrated notifications to alert users about upcoming appointments, vaccination dates, prescription refills, and more via email and SMS.
