- Secure storage of comprehensive health records (medical history, prescriptions, treatment records, etc.).
- Easy access for students to view past medical records and treatment history.
- Automated generation of documentation (e.g., medical certificates and leave permissions).
- A user-friendly, responsive interface optimized for both mobile and web.

## Key Features

  A responsive design that ensures a seamless experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
